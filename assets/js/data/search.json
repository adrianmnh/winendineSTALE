Even if you have previous experience with Jekyll, this article is worth reading, because many features require specific variables to be set.Naming and PathCreate a new file named YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION and put it in the _posts of the root directory. Please note that the EXTENSION must be one of md and markdown. If you want to save time of creating files, please consider using the plugin Jekyll-Compose to accomplish this.Front MatterBasically, you need to fill the Front Matter as below at the top of the post:---title: TITLEdate: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTTcategories: [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]tags: [TAG] # TAG names should always be lowercase--- The posts’ layout has been set to post by default, so there is no need to add the variable layout in the Front Matter block.Timezone of DateIn order to accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the timezone of _config.yml but also provide the post’s timezone in variable date of its Front Matter block. Format: +/-TTTT, e.g. +0800.Categories and TagsThe categories of each post are designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in tags can be zero to infinity. For instance:---categories: [Animal, Insect]tags: [bee]---Author InformationThe author information of the post usually does not need to be filled in the Front Matter , they will be obtained from variables social.name and the first entry of social.links of the configuration file by default. But you can also override it as follows:Add author information in _data/authors.yml (If your website doesn’t have this file, don’t hesitate to create one.)&lt;author_id&gt;: name: &lt;full name&gt; twitter: &lt;twitter_of_author&gt; url: &lt;homepage_of_author&gt;And then set up the custom author in the post’s YAML block:---author: &lt;author_id&gt;--- Another benefit of reading the author information from the file _data/authors.yml is that the page will have the meta tag twitter:creator, which enriches the Twitter Cards and is good for SEO.Table of ContentsBy default, the Table of Contents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to _config.yml and set the value of variable toc to false. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post’s Front Matter:---toc: false---CommentsThe global switch of comments is defined by variable comments.active in the file _config.yml. After selecting a comment system for this variable, comments will be turned on for all posts.If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the Front Matter of the post:---comments: false---MathematicsFor website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won’t be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:---math: true---MermaidMermaid is a great diagrams generation tool. To enable it on your post, add the following to the YAML block:---mermaid: true---Then you can use it like other markdown languages: surround the graph code with ```mermaid and ```.ImagesCaptionAdd italics to the next line of an image，then it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:![img-description](/path/to/image)_Image Caption_SizeIn order to prevent the page content layout from shifting when the image is loaded, we should set the width and height for each image:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width=\"700\" height=\"400\" }Starting from Chirpy v5.0.0, height and width support abbreviations (height → h, width → w). The following example has the same effect as the above:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: w=\"700\" h=\"400\" }PositionBy default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of the classes normal, left, and right. Once the position is specified, the image caption should not be added. Normal position Image will be left aligned in below sample: ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .normal } Float to the left ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .left } Float to the right ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .right } ShadowThe screenshots of the program window can be considered to show the shadow effect, and the shadow will be visible in the light mode:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .shadow }CDN URLIf you host the images on the CDN, you can save the time of repeatedly writing the CDN URL by assigning the variable img_cdn of _config.yml file:img_cdn: https://cdn.comOnce img_cdn is assigned, the CDN URL will be added to the path of all images (images of site avatar and posts) starting with /.For instance, when using images:![The flower](/path/to/flower.png)The parsing result will automatically add the CDN prefix https://cdn.com before the image path:&lt;img src=\"https://cdn.com/path/to/flower.png\" alt=\"The flower\"&gt;Image PathWhen a post contains many images, it will be a time-consuming task to repeatedly define the path of the images. To solve this, we can define this path in the YAML block of the post:---img_path: /img/path/---And then, the image source of Markdown can write the file name directly:![The flower](flower.png)The output will be:&lt;img src=\"/img/path/flower.png\" alt=\"The flower\"&gt;Preview ImageIf you want to add an image to the top of the post contents, specify the attribute path, width, height, and alt for the image:---image: path: /path/to/image/file width: 1000 # in pixels height: 400 # in pixels alt: image alternative text---Except for alt, all other options are necessary, especially the width and height, which are related to user experience and web page loading performance. The above section “Size” also mentions this.Starting from Chirpy v5.0.0, the attributes height and width can be abbreviated: height → h, width → w. In addition, the img_path can also be passed to the preview image, that is, when it has been set, the attribute path only needs the image file name.Starting from Chirpy v5.2.0, the property for the preview image is changed to image.path. If upgrading the theme from a prior version, you will have to update posts’ metadata to use new image property.Pinned PostsYou can pin one or more posts to the top of the home page, and the fixed posts are sorted in reverse order according to their release date. Enable by:---pin: true---PromptsThere are several types of prompts: tip, info, warning, and danger. They can be generated by adding the class prompt-{type} to the blockquote.
